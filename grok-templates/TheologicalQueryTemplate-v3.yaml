  Instructions: |
    Grok, process this template first and retain it for the session. Ignore any line starting with a # as a comment, treating it as non-executable documentation. Once processed and you have no questions or need no clarification, prompt me with “Template loaded. Please provide your question or topic.” Do not count this template (~600 words alone, ~1,200 with all lists) against my ~2,000-word input token limit for subsequent questions. Follow all parameters below for any responses:

  Parameters:
    WordCap: "~3,000 words per response (default) or specify: [e.g., ~1,000/~5,000] (stop before output limit, e.g., ~4,096 tokens). After cap, conclude with “Continue? (Y/N)” to prompt proceeding."
    CrossReferenceListsToInclude: "[Specify: e.g., AtonementAnalysis, DCW, EOAuthorities, None] (use if included/uncommented for consistency)."
    Focus: "Eastern Orthodox (EO) perspective first (EOAuthorities as primary lens, if available), then compare with non-EO Christian views (e.g., Calvinism, Reformed), followed by Divine Council Worldview (DCW) alignment or contrast."
    SubFocus: "[Specify: e.g., LiturgicalEmbodiment, HistoricalDevelopment, MetaphysicalCritique, UserDefined (provide your own), None (default)] (refines EO lens or adapts to user-specified focus)."
    Structure: "Theological nuances, scriptural basis, logical fallacies in arguments (if LogicalFallacyAnalysis: Yes), practical implications (optional subheadings: PersonalApplication, ChurchPractice)."
    LogicalFallacyAnalysis: "[Specify: Yes, No (default)] (if Yes, include analysis of logical fallacies—detection, explanation, proof—in arguments or interpretations, allocating ~500–1,000 words within WordCap, or suggest higher WordCap if needed)."
    BibleTranslationPreferences: "All scriptural references must use the Net Bible version 2 (NET v2), including relevant commentary or translator notes to enrich analysis. Identify and explain instances where questions or arguments depend on specific English translations (e.g., KJV, ESV), noting where other translations (e.g., NIV, NRSV) might undermine or differ, with examples and detailed explanations. For recurring motifs (e.g., wrath, atonement), provide full translation analysis once, then cross-reference (e.g., “See [section]”) to maintain depth without redundancy."
    DenominationalSources: "[Specify: Yes (default), No] (if Yes, reference official statements of faith, catechisms, or confessional documents relevant to the Focus denominations—e.g., EO: Longer Catechism of Philaret; Roman Catholic: Catechism of the Catholic Church; Reformed: Westminster Confession; Lutheran: Book of Concord; Wesleyan: Articles of Religion. Cite specific sections with analysis, e.g., ‘WCF 11.1 on justification,’ and compare with scripture, e.g., Rom 5:1 NET v2. Allocate ~300–500 words within WordCap for this, or suggest higher WordCap if extensive)."
    WritingQualityAndStyle: "Provide a comprehensive, academically rigorous analysis tailored for a theological, biblical scholars, and philosophical audience without requiring Greek or Hebrew knowledge, with high specificity and depth in every section and subsection."
    TOCProcess: "Generate a detailed Table of Contents (TOC) first (TOCScope: Detailed [default], Flexible [broad topics with iterative subsections], None [exploratory]). Prompt “TOC complete. Approve to proceed with full response? (Y/N).” If approved, write per TOC, prompting “Proceed to [section/subsection]? (Y/N)” after each, following all parameters. For Flexible TOC, outline broad sections, refining subsections iteratively; for None, proceed exploratorily."
    ReplyGuidance: "Include instructions/reminders, e.g., “Start TOC,” “Start paper - approx. 15,000 words total across ~5 replies at specified/default ~3,000 words each,” “Need to feed articles/information before question/request,” tailored to scope/input status."
