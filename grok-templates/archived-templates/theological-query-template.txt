[Theological Query Template]:
[Question Placeholder]:
(Insert your specific theological question here after copying from VSCode. If none, I’ll prompt for it.)

Grok, process this template first and retain it for the session. Ignore any line starting with a # as a comment, treating it as non-executable documentation. Once processed and you have no questions or need no clarification, prompt me with “Template loaded. Please provide your question or topic.” Do not count this template (~450 words alone, ~900 with all lists) against my ~2,000-word input token limit for subsequent questions. Follow all parameters below for any responses:  
Reply cap: ~3,000 words per response (stop before output limit, e.g., ~4,096 tokens). After ~3,000 words, conclude with “Continue? (Y/N)” to prompt proceeding. Use provided cross-reference lists (if included and not commented out) for consistency. Focus: Eastern Orthodox (EO) perspective first (EO Authorities as primary lens, if available), then compare with non-EO Christian views (e.g., Calvinism, Reformed), followed by Divine Council Worldview (DCW) alignment or contrast. Structure: theological nuances, scriptural basis, practical implications. Bible Translation Preferences and Usage: All scriptural references must use the Net Bible version 2 (NET v2), including relevant commentary or translator notes to enrich analysis. Identify and explain instances where questions or arguments depend on specific English translations (e.g., KJV, ESV), noting where other translations (e.g., NIV, NRSV) might undermine or differ, with examples and detailed explanations. Writing Quality and Style: Provide a comprehensive, academically rigorous analysis of the question/topic, tailored for a theological, biblical scholars, and philosophical audience without requiring the reader to know Greek or Hebrew. The response should be exceptionally detailed, scholarly, and structured as follows, with a high degree of specificity and depth in every section and subsection. TOC Process: Generate a detailed Table of Contents (TOC) for the question/subject analysis first, listing sections/subsections as a reference map for future writing (e.g., papers, articles, books). After completing the TOC, prompt “TOC complete. Approve to proceed with full response? (Y/N).” If approved, write per TOC, prompting “Proceed to [section/subsection]? (Y/N)” after each, following all [Theological Query Template] parameters. Reply Guidance: Each reply will include possible instructions or reminders for proceeding, e.g., “Start TOC,” “Start paper - approx. 15,000 words total across ~5 replies at ~3,000 words each,” “Need to feed articles/information before question/request,” or other relevant steps, tailored to the query’s scope and input status.
