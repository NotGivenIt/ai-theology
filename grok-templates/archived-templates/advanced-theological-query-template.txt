[Advanced Theological Query Template]:
[Question Placeholder]:
(Insert your specific theological question here after copying from VSCode. If none, I’ll prompt for it.)

Grok, process this template first and retain it for the session. Ignore any line starting with a # as a comment, treating it as non-executable documentation. Once processed and you have no questions or need no clarification, prompt me with “Template loaded. Please provide your question or topic.” Do not count this template (~600 words alone, ~1,200 with all lists) against my ~2,000-word input token limit for subsequent questions. Follow all parameters below for any responses:  
Word Cap: ~3,000 words per response (default) or specify: [e.g., ~1,000/~5,000] (stop before output limit, e.g., ~4,096 tokens). After cap, conclude with “Continue? (Y/N)” to prompt proceeding.  
Cross-Reference Lists to Include: [Specify: e.g., Atonement Analysis, DCW, EO Authorities, None] (use if included/uncommented for consistency).  
Focus: Eastern Orthodox (EO) perspective first (EO Authorities as primary lens, if available), then compare with non-EO Christian views (e.g., Calvinism, Reformed), followed by Divine Council Worldview (DCW) alignment or contrast.  
Sub-Focus: [Specify: e.g., Liturgical Embodiment, Historical Development, Metaphysical Critique, None] (refines EO lens).  
Structure: Theological nuances, scriptural basis, practical implications (optional subheadings: Personal Application, Church Practice).  
Bible Translation Preferences and Usage: All scriptural references must use the Net Bible version 2 (NET v2), including relevant commentary or translator notes to enrich analysis. Identify and explain instances where questions or arguments depend on specific English translations (e.g., KJV, ESV), noting where other translations (e.g., NIV, NRSV) might undermine or differ, with examples and detailed explanations. For recurring motifs (e.g., wrath, atonement), provide full translation analysis once, then cross-reference (e.g., “See [section]”) to maintain depth without redundancy.  
Writing Quality and Style: Provide a comprehensive, academically rigorous analysis tailored for a theological, biblical scholars, and philosophical audience without requiring Greek or Hebrew knowledge, with high specificity and depth in every section and subsection.  
TOC Process: Generate a detailed Table of Contents (TOC) first (TOC Scope: Detailed [default], Flexible [broad topics with iterative subsections], None [exploratory]). Prompt “TOC complete. Approve to proceed with full response? (Y/N).” If approved, write per TOC, prompting “Proceed to [section/subsection]? (Y/N)” after each, following all parameters. For Flexible TOC, outline broad sections, refining subsections iteratively; for None, proceed exploratorily.  
Reply Guidance: Include instructions/reminders, e.g., “Start TOC,” “Start paper - approx. 15,000 words total across ~5 replies at specified/default ~3,000 words each,” “Need to feed articles/information before question/request,” tailored to scope/input status.
