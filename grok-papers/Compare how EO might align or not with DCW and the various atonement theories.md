[DCW Cross-Reference Summary:

The Divine Council Worldview (DCW) (Heiser, cosmic rebellion/redemption): Yahweh
rules elohim council (Ps 82, Deut 32:8-9 NET v2); three rebellions—Gen 3
(serpent/elohim, NET v2: “shining being”), Gen 6 (Nephilim), Gen 11
(Babel)—disrupt order. Christ triumphs (Col 2:15 NET v2), restoring humans as
image-bearers (Imes), covenant Israel (Staples), via allegiance (Bates).
Integrates Ransom (recapitulation), Christus Victor (cosmic victory),
Participation (theosis); PSA possible (sin’s rift, Rom 3:25 NET v2). Enhanced by
Halsted (apocalyptic), Segal (divine agency), Van Dorn (soteriology),
Wright/Stuckenbruck (conflict), Bautch/Walton (ANE context, Lev 16:16 NET v2).]

[Biblical Anthropology Cross-Reference Summary:

Humanity created in God’s image (Gen 1:26-27, Imes: vice-regents, EO: likeness
for theosis); purpose: communion with God, ruling earth (Ps 8:6, EO:
deification, 2 Pet 1:4). Nature: body/soul unity (Gen 2:7 NET v2: “living
being,” EO: holistic vs. non-EO: dichotomy/trichotomy, 1 Thess 5:23). Sin:
corruption, not total loss (EO: ancestral sin, Rom 5:12—free will preserved vs.
non-EO: total depravity, Augustine/Calvin). Destiny: theosis (EO: divinization,
Athanasius) or glorification (non-EO: imputed righteousness, Rom 8:29).
Themes—Image (EO: dynamic growth vs. static), Fall (sin’s wound vs. guilt),
Restoration (union vs. forensic). Influenced by Walton (ANE agency), Lossky (EO:
mystical renewal), Wright (new humanity). Intersects DCW: image restored
post-elohim rebellions (Heiser), ties to Participation.]

# Answer:

Below is a \~1,000-word comparison of how Eastern Orthodoxy (EO) aligns or
diverges with the Divine Council Worldview (DCW) and the various atonement
theories, using your cross-reference lists. I’ll stop before hitting any output
limit (estimated \~4,096 tokens/\~3,000 words) and prompt you to proceed, per
your request. I’ll leverage EO Authorities (e.g., Maximus, Athanasius) and DCW
contributors (e.g., Heiser, Imes) for depth, while analyzing against the
atonement theories and themes.

### Comparison: EO, DCW, and Atonement Theories (\~998 words)

#### Core Frameworks

**Eastern Orthodoxy (EO)** views atonement through a lens of
*theosis*—humanity’s divinization or union with God’s nature (2 Pet 1:4,
Anthropology: Destiny). Rooted in the Fathers (e.g., Athanasius: “God became man
so we might become God”), EO sees sin as ancestral corruption (Rom 5:12,
Anthropology: Sin), not total depravity, healed by Christ’s incarnation and
resurrection. This aligns with Participation (union with God, Jn 17:21) and
Restoration (healing creation, Rom 8:19-21). Maximus the Confessor frames this
cosmically: Christ recapitulates creation, uniting divine and human (EO
Authorities: cosmic Christology), emphasizing Reconciliation over wrath.

**Divine Council Worldview (DCW)** (Heiser) posits a cosmic rebellion/redemption
narrative: Yahweh rules an *elohim* council (Ps 82), disrupted by three
rebellions—Gen 3 (serpent/*elohim*), Gen 6 (Nephilim), Gen 11 (Babel). Christ’s
triumph (Col 2:15) restores humanity as image-bearers (Imes) and covenant Israel
(Staples), integrating Ransom (recapitulation), Christus Victor (powers
defeated), and Participation (*theosis*) (DCW Summary). Sin is *elohim*-induced
bondage (Themes: Sin), reversed via cosmic victory and allegiance (Bates).

#### Alignment Points

1.  **Cosmic Scope and Restoration**:

    1.  **EO**: Maximus sees Christ’s work as cosmic renewal (EO Authorities),
        healing all creation from sin’s wound (Anthropology: Restoration).
        Gregory Palamas’ divine energies enable universal participation (Themes:
        Cosmic Scope).

    2.  **DCW**: Heiser’s *elohim* rebellions (Gen 3-11) disrupt cosmic order;
        Christ’s victory (Col 2:15) restores it, reclaiming nations (Deut
        32:8-9, Themes: Cosmic Scope). Imes’ image-bearers align with EO’s
        renewed humanity.

    3.  **Atonement Tie**: Both resonate with Christus Victor (powers defeated)
        and Participation (*theosis*), emphasizing Restoration over individual
        guilt. Ransom’s Recapitulation (Irenaeus) fits too—Christ undoes Adam’s
        fall (EO) and *elohim* corruption (DCW).

2.  **Human Destiny (Divinization)**:

    1.  **EO**: *Theosis* is the goal (Athanasius, 2 Pet 1:4, Anthropology:
        Destiny). Symeon the New Theologian stresses mystical union, not
        forensic pardon (Themes: Human Destiny).

    2.  **DCW**: Restoration as image-bearers (Imes) and loyalty to Christ
        (Bates) echo *theosis*, though less mystically (DCW Summary:
        Participation). Humanity resumes its vice-regent role post-rebellion
        (Themes: Human Destiny).

    3.  **Atonement Tie**: Participation aligns perfectly—EO’s union with God
        mirrors DCW’s restored purpose. Ransom’s Divinization motif (Athanasius)
        bridges both, contrasting PSA’s imputed righteousness (non-EO).

3.  **Christ’s Role (Victory and Representation)**:

    1.  **EO**: Basil of Caesarea and Gregory of Nazianzus see Christ as victor
        and mediator (EO Authorities), incarnating to defeat death (1 Cor 15:26,
        Themes: Christ’s Role). No wrath-bearing substitute.

    2.  **DCW**: Christ triumphs over *elohim* (Col 2:15, Christus Victor),
        acting representatively (Imes, Staples) to restore humanity (Themes:
        Christ’s Role).

    3.  **Atonement Tie**: Both favor Christus Victor and Vicarious Substitute
        (non-PSA, Heb 2:17), focusing on Redemption and Reconciliation, not
        Propitiation or Satisfaction.

#### Divergence Points

1.  **Sin’s Nature and Divine Justice**:

    1.  **EO**: Sin is corruption, not guilt requiring wrath (Anthropology:
        Fall). Lossky and Florovsky reject penal models, seeing Divine Justice
        as love and order, not punishment (Themes: Divine Justice).

    2.  **DCW**: Sin is *elohim*-driven bondage (Gen 3 serpent, Themes: Sin),
        with Christ’s victory restoring order (Col 2:15). PSA is possible (Rom
        3:25, sin’s rift), suggesting wrath as an option (DCW Summary).

    3.  **Atonement Tie**: EO clashes with PSA (wrath borne, Isa 53:5)—John of
        Damascus avoids legalism, while DCW’s openness to PSA (Van Dorn)
        diverges. EO leans to Expiation (cleansing), DCW to Redemption
        (liberation).

2.  **Mystical vs. Cosmic Emphasis**:

    1.  **EO**: Gregory Palamas (hesychasm) and Stăniloaie (personalist
        *theosis*) prioritize mystical union (EO Authorities), less focused on
        cosmic hierarchies (Themes: Human Destiny).

    2.  **DCW**: Heiser’s *elohim* council (Ps 82) and rebellions (Gen 6, 11)
        emphasize a structured cosmic battle (DCW Summary: Christus Victor),
        less mystical than EO.

    3.  **Atonement Tie**: EO’s Participation is inward-focused (union), while
        DCW’s Christus Victor is outward (victory). Moral Influence (Abelard)
        fits EO’s love emphasis but not DCW’s supernatural lens.

3.  **Covenant and Israel**:

    1.  **EO**: Covenant is implicit in Christ’s new covenant (Heb 8:10,
        Atonement: Covenant), but less Israel-centric—Florovsky focuses on
        universal Church (EO Authorities).

    2.  **DCW**: Staples ties atonement to Israel’s covenant role (Deut 32:9),
        fulfilled in Christ (DCW Summary), grounding cosmic redemption in
        Israel’s story.

    3.  **Atonement Tie**: DCW’s Covenant focus aligns with Governmental
        (justice upheld), while EO’s universalism downplays this, favoring
        Reconciliation.

#### Atonement Theories Comparison

-   **Ransom**: EO (Athanasius’ Divinization, Irenaeus’ Recapitulation) and DCW
    (recapitulation vs. *elohim*) align strongly—Christ undoes corruption (EO)
    and rebellion (DCW), emphasizing Restoration.

-   **Satisfaction**: EO rejects Anselm’s honor-debt (Meyendorff), favoring
    *theosis*; DCW’s cosmic order (Walton) could fit Satisfaction loosely, but
    not a priority.

-   **PSA**: EO (Lossky) opposes wrath/legalism; DCW allows it (Rom 3:25, Van
    Dorn), creating tension—EO prefers Expiation, DCW blends with Christus
    Victor.

-   **Moral Influence**: EO’s love (Symeon) aligns somewhat, but DCW’s *elohim*
    focus (Heiser) rejects this as too human-centric.

-   **Christus Victor**: Strong alignment—EO’s victory over death (Basil) and
    DCW’s *elohim* defeat (Col 2:15) share Redemption and Cosmic Scope.

-   **Participation**: Core to both—EO’s *theosis* (Maximus) and DCW’s image
    restoration (Imes) unite humanity with God (Themes: Human Destiny).

-   **Governmental**: EO ignores justice models; DCW’s order (Staples) could fit
    faintly, but not central.

#### Synthesis

EO and DCW align on cosmic restoration, *theosis*/Participation, and Christus
Victor, rejecting PSA’s wrath focus. EO’s mystical union contrasts DCW’s
structured *elohim* narrative, and EO downplays covenant-Israel specifics DCW
emphasizes. Both elevate Human Destiny and Cosmic Scope over Divine Justice as
wrath.

Let me know if you’d like me to proceed or adjust anything!

Continuing from the \~998-word comparison of Eastern Orthodoxy (EO), the Divine
Council Worldview (DCW), and atonement theories, I’ll wrap up any loose ends and
deepen the analysis within another \~1,000 words, stopping before the output
limit (\~4,096 tokens/\~3,000 words total) and prompting you again. This section
will focus on practical implications, additional EO Fathers’ insights, and a
final synthesis, using your cross-reference lists to ensure consistency.

### Continued Comparison: EO, DCW, and Atonement Theories (\~996 words)

#### Practical Implications for Theology

1.  **Sin and Salvation**:

    1.  **EO**: The ancestral sin model (Anthropology: Sin) implies salvation as
        a healing process—Christ’s incarnation cleanses corruption (Expiation, 1
        Jn 2:2), per Maximus’ cosmic Christology (EO Authorities). Vladimir
        Lossky emphasizes mystical participation over legal pardon (Themes:
        Restoration), aligning with Symeon the New Theologian’s focus on
        experiential union (EO Authorities: mystical union). This shapes a
        praxis of prayer, asceticism, and the Eucharist to achieve *theosis*.

    2.  **DCW**: Sin as *elohim*-induced bondage (Gen 3 serpent, DCW Summary)
        suggests salvation as liberation and realignment under Yahweh’s rule
        (Redemption, Mk 10:45). Heiser’s rebellions (Gen 6, 11) frame Christ’s
        triumph (Col 2:15) as cosmic deliverance (Christus Victor), with Bates’
        allegiance (DCW Summary) calling for active loyalty (Themes: Christ’s
        Role). Praxis here might emphasize spiritual warfare and covenant
        identity (Staples).

    3.  **Atonement Impact**: EO’s Participation and DCW’s blend of Christus
        Victor/Ransom (recapitulation) converge on Restoration, but EO’s inward
        focus contrasts DCW’s cosmic battle. PSA’s guilt-driven salvation (Isa
        53:5) fits neither cleanly, though DCW tolerates it more (Rom 3:25).

2.  **Human Destiny in Practice**:

    1.  **EO**: *Theosis* (2 Pet 1:4, Anthropology: Destiny) is lived out
        through synergy—human cooperation with grace—per Gregory Palamas’ divine
        energies (EO Authorities: hesychasm). John of Damascus synthesizes this
        as humanity’s telos (EO Authorities: theology synthesis), not a forensic
        state (contrast non-EO glorification, Rom 8:29). This informs EO liturgy
        and sacramental life.

    2.  **DCW**: Restored image-bearers (Imes, DCW Summary) resume co-rulership
        (Ps 8:6), reflecting Yahweh’s order post-*elohim* defeat (Themes: Human
        Destiny). This practical destiny, tied to covenant Israel (Staples),
        suggests a missional role—extending Christ’s victory (Col 2:15). Less
        mystical than EO, it’s about cosmic function (Walton, ANE agency).

    3.  **Atonement Impact**: Participation unites both—EO’s divinization and
        DCW’s restored vice-regency—but EO’s mystical ascent diverges from DCW’s
        governance focus. Ransom’s Divinization (Athanasius) bridges them, while
        Moral Influence (Abelard) aligns faintly with EO’s love but not DCW’s
        supernatural victory.

3.  **Cosmic Scope and Ecclesiology**:

    1.  **EO**: Georges Florovsky’s neo-patristic synthesis (EO Authorities)
        sees the Church as the locus of cosmic renewal (Themes: Cosmic Scope),
        embodying Christ’s victory over death (1 Cor 15:26). Basil of Caesarea
        ties this to creation’s sanctification (EO Authorities: creation),
        universal but not Israel-specific.

    2.  **DCW**: Heiser’s *elohim* narrative (Ps 82) and Staples’ covenant
        Israel (Deut 32:9) frame the Church as inheritors of a cosmic
        reclamation (Col 2:15, Themes: Cosmic Scope), reversing Babel (Gen 11).
        This is more structured—nations under Yahweh vs. rebellious *elohim*.

    3.  **Atonement Impact**: Christus Victor (Aulén) fits both—EO’s death
        defeated, DCW’s *elohim* subdued—enhancing Redemption. EO’s
        Reconciliation (2 Cor 5:18-19) is universal, while DCW’s Covenant lean
        could align with Governmental (justice upheld), though EO ignores this.

#### Insights from Additional EO Fathers

-   **Gregory of Nazianzus**: His focus on Christ’s redemptive incarnation (EO
    Authorities: Trinity, redemption) rejects wrath models, aligning with EO’s
    Expiation over Propitiation (Rom 3:25). This supports Christus Victor and
    Participation, resonating with DCW’s triumph (Col 2:15) but not its PSA
    potential.

-   **John Meyendorff**: Building on Palamas, he sees atonement as restoring
    communion (EO Authorities: Palamite theology), not satisfying justice
    (contra Satisfaction, Anselm). This diverges from DCW’s possible PSA lean
    (Rom 3:25) but aligns with its Restoration theme (Imes).

-   **Dumitru Stăniloaie**: His personalist *theosis* (EO Authorities)
    emphasizes relational union, not cosmic hierarchy, contrasting DCW’s
    *elohim* focus (Heiser). Yet, both share a Restoration goal—EO inwardly, DCW
    outwardly.

-   **Michael Pomazansky**: His dogmatic clarity (EO Authorities) reinforces
    EO’s rejection of legal atonement (PSA, Satisfaction), favoring
    Participation, which DCW partially adopts via Bates and Imes.

#### Final Synthesis Across Atonement Theories

-   **Ransom**: EO’s Recapitulation (Irenaeus) and Divinization (Athanasius)
    align with DCW’s undoing of *elohim* rebellions (Gen 3, 6), both emphasizing
    Restoration over wrath (Themes: Sin as corruption/bondage). Vicarious
    Substitute (non-PSA) fits both—Christ represents humanity (EO: incarnation,
    DCW: Imes).

-   **Satisfaction**: EO Fathers (e.g., Meyendorff) reject Anselm’s honor-debt,
    focusing on *theosis* (Themes: Divine Justice as love). DCW’s cosmic order
    (Walton) might allow a loose fit, but it’s not central—both prioritize
    Restoration over Satisfaction.

-   **Penal Substitution (PSA)**: EO’s aversion to wrath (Lossky, John of
    Damascus) clashes with PSA (Isa 53:5, Themes: Divine Justice as wrath).
    DCW’s openness (Van Dorn, Rom 3:25) tolerates it as sin’s cosmic rift, but
    EO’s Expiation and DCW’s Christus Victor dominate instead.

-   **Moral Influence**: EO’s love emphasis (Symeon) partially aligns (1 Pet
    2:21), but its mystical depth exceeds Abelard’s ethic. DCW’s *elohim* focus
    (Heiser) rejects this as too human-centric, favoring supernatural victory
    (Themes: Christ’s Role).

-   **Christus Victor**: Strongest alignment—EO’s defeat of death (Basil) and
    DCW’s *elohim* triumph (Col 2:15) share Redemption and Cosmic Scope. EO adds
    *theosis*, DCW adds covenant specificity (Staples).

-   **Participation**: Core to both—EO’s *theosis* (Maximus, 2 Pet 1:4) and
    DCW’s image restoration (Imes) unite humanity with God (Themes: Human
    Destiny). EO’s mysticism contrasts DCW’s cosmic narrative, but both reject
    forensic models.

-   **Governmental**: EO ignores justice frameworks (Florovsky), while DCW’s
    order restoration (Staples) faintly aligns (Isa 42:21). Neither prioritizes
    this over Restoration.

#### Conclusion

EO and DCW converge on a non-wrath, cosmic atonement—Participation (*theosis*),
Christus Victor (victory), and Ransom (recapitulation)—rooted in Restoration and
Reconciliation. EO’s mystical, universal focus (Maximus, Palamas) contrasts
DCW’s structured *elohim* cosmology (Heiser), with EO rejecting PSA/Satisfaction
and DCW tolerating PSA faintly. Human Destiny (*theosis* vs. vice-regency) and
Sin (wound vs. bondage) align in goal but differ in flavor, enriching each other
against atonement theories.

Let me know if you’d like me to proceed further (e.g., more Fathers, practical
applications) or adjust anything!

Continuing from the \~1,994-word comparison of Eastern Orthodoxy (EO), the
Divine Council Worldview (DCW), and atonement theories, I’ll add insights from
more EO Fathers and explore practical applications in another \~1,000 words.
This will bring the total to \~3,000 words—nearing my estimated output limit
(\~4,096 tokens/\~3,000-3,500 words)—so I’ll stop and prompt you before hitting
it. Using your cross-reference lists, I’ll deepen the analysis and tie it to
praxis, maintaining consistency.

### Continued Comparison: EO, DCW, and Atonement Theories (\~992 words)

#### Additional Insights from EO Fathers

1.  **Athanasius of Alexandria**:

    1.  **View**: In *On the Incarnation*, Athanasius asserts Christ’s
        incarnation heals corruption (EO Authorities: *theosis*, 2 Pet 1:4), not
        appeases wrath (Anthropology: Sin). Sin is mortality from Adam (Rom
        5:12), reversed by divine-human union (Themes: Restoration).

    2.  **EO vs. DCW**: Aligns with Participation—humanity’s divinization
        mirrors DCW’s image restoration (Imes, DCW Summary). Athanasius’ cosmic
        renewal (death defeated, 1 Cor 15:26) echoes DCW’s Christus Victor (Col
        2:15), though without *elohim* specificity (Heiser).

    3.  **Atonement Tie**: Strong Ransom fit—Divinization (Athanasius) and
        Recapitulation (undoing Adam, Rom 5:19) match DCW’s rebellion reversal
        (Gen 3). PSA (wrath borne) is absent, favoring Expiation (1 Jn 2:2).

2.  **Gregory of Nazianzus**:

    1.  **View**: His *Oration 45* sees Christ’s death as a victory over death
        and corruption (EO Authorities: redemption), not a legal transaction
        (Themes: Christ’s Role). Humanity regains life through Christ’s
        resurrection (Themes: Human Destiny).

    2.  **EO vs. DCW**: Shares Christus Victor with DCW (powers defeated, Col
        2:15), emphasizing Redemption (Mk 10:45). Less focus on *elohim* (DCW:
        Gen 6) but aligns with cosmic healing (Anthropology: Restoration).

    3.  **Atonement Tie**: Supports Participation (union with God, Jn 17:21) and
        Vicarious Substitute (non-PSA, Heb 2:17), rejecting Satisfaction
        (Anselm) or Moral Influence’s simplicity.

3.  **Basil of Caesarea**:

    1.  **View**: In *On the Holy Spirit*, Basil ties atonement to creation’s
        sanctification (EO Authorities: creation), where Christ’s work renews
        all things (Rom 8:21, Themes: Cosmic Scope). Sin is a cosmic wound, not
        guilt (Anthropology: Fall).

    2.  **EO vs. DCW**: Parallels DCW’s Restoration—Christ triumphs (Col 2:15,
        DCW Summary) to reorder creation post-*elohim* rebellions (Gen 11).
        Basil’s universal lens lacks DCW’s covenant Israel focus (Staples).

    3.  **Atonement Tie**: Fits Christus Victor and Participation, emphasizing
        Reconciliation (2 Cor 5:18-19), not Propitiation (Rom 3:25).

4.  **John of Damascus**:

    1.  **View**: His *Exact Exposition* synthesizes atonement as Christ’s
        life-giving act (EO Authorities: theology synthesis), restoring
        humanity’s path to God (Anthropology: Image). No penal
        substitution—focus is on life over death.

    2.  **EO vs. DCW**: Aligns with DCW’s Restoration (Imes) and Participation
        (*theosis*, Bates), but skips *elohim* narrative (Heiser). Both see
        Christ as victor (Themes: Christ’s Role).

    3.  **Atonement Tie**: Rejects PSA (Isa 53:5) for Expiation and Ransom
        (recapitulation), complementing DCW’s cosmic victory (Col 2:15).

#### Practical Applications

1.  **Worship and Liturgy**:

    1.  **EO**: Gregory Palamas’ hesychasm (EO Authorities) shapes EO
        prayer—silence and the Jesus Prayer foster *theosis* (Anthropology:
        Destiny). The Eucharist, per Basil, is cosmic renewal (Themes: Cosmic
        Scope), uniting believers with Christ (Participation). John of Damascus’
        liturgical theology (EO Authorities) celebrates incarnation as
        salvation’s heart (Restoration).

        1.  **Alignment**: EO worship reflects Participation and Ransom
            (Divinization)—a lived *theosis*—not PSA’s guilt focus.

    2.  **DCW**: Worship could emphasize Christ’s triumph over *elohim* (Col
        2:15, DCW Summary), with hymns or prayers reclaiming creation (Christus
        Victor). Bates’ allegiance (DCW Summary) suggests covenant loyalty
        (Themes: Covenant), possibly through communal vows or exorcistic rites
        (Halsted, apocalyptic).

        1.  **Alignment**: DCW aligns with Christus Victor and Participation,
            adding a cosmic warfare tone absent in EO’s mysticism.

    3.  **Contrast**: EO’s inward union (Lossky) vs. DCW’s outward victory
        (Heiser) shapes different liturgical flavors—mystical vs. triumphant.

2.  **Spiritual Formation**:

    1.  **EO**: Maximus’ cosmic Christology (EO Authorities) calls for
        asceticism—overcoming passions—to align with Christ’s renewal
        (Anthropology: Restoration). Symeon’s mystical union (EO Authorities)
        urges personal encounter with God (Themes: Human Destiny), not just
        moral reform (contra Moral Influence).

        1.  **Alignment**: Participation (*theosis*) drives EO formation,
            resonating with Ransom’s healing motif (Athanasius).

    2.  **DCW**: Imes’ image-bearers (DCW Summary) imply formation as co-rulers
        (Ps 8:6), resisting *elohim* influence (Gen 3, Themes: Sin). Bates’
        allegiance fosters loyalty to Christ’s kingship (Themes: Christ’s Role),
        potentially through study of cosmic order (Walton).

        1.  **Alignment**: DCW blends Participation and Christus
            Victor—formation as restored function and victory.

    3.  **Contrast**: EO’s ascetic *theosis* (Stăniloaie) is personal, while
        DCW’s vice-regency (Heiser) is missional, impacting atonement praxis
        (Restoration vs. Redemption).

3.  **Mission and Ethics**:

    1.  **EO**: Florovsky’s Church as renewal (EO Authorities) drives
        mission—spreading *theosis* universally (Themes: Cosmic Scope). Gregory
        of Nazianzus’ redemption focus (EO Authorities) inspires care for
        creation (Rom 8:21), not legal atonement (contra PSA).

        1.  **Alignment**: Participation and Reconciliation guide EO
            ethics—living Christ’s life.

    2.  **DCW**: Staples’ covenant Israel (DCW Summary) suggests mission as
        extending Christ’s victory (Col 2:15) over nations (Deut 32:9, Themes:
        Cosmic Scope). Wright/Stuckenbruck’s conflict lens (DCW Summary) could
        inspire ethics resisting spiritual oppression (Christus Victor).

        1.  **Alignment**: DCW’s Christus Victor and Covenant fuel a cosmic
            mission.

    3.  **Contrast**: EO’s universal communion (Meyendorff) vs. DCW’s structured
        reclamation (Heiser) differ—EO heals inwardly, DCW conquers outwardly.

#### Synthesis with Atonement Theories

-   **EO Fathers**: Athanasius, Gregory of Nazianzus, Basil, and John of
    Damascus reinforce Participation (*theosis*), Christus Victor (death’s
    defeat), and Ransom (recapitulation), rejecting PSA (wrath) and Satisfaction
    (honor). Practical focus is *theosis* via liturgy and asceticism
    (Restoration).

-   **DCW**: Integrates these with *elohim*-specific Christus Victor (Col 2:15),
    Participation (image restoration), and Ransom (rebellion reversal),
    tolerating PSA faintly (Rom 3:25). Praxis emphasizes victory and covenant
    loyalty (Redemption).

-   **Alignment**: Both prioritize cosmic renewal (Themes: Cosmic Scope),
    differing in EO’s mysticism (Lossky) vs. DCW’s cosmology (Heiser). Neither
    leans on Moral Influence or Governmental heavily.

#### Conclusion

EO Fathers and praxis amplify *theosis* and victory, aligning with DCW’s cosmic
restoration but diverging on *elohim* specificity and wrath. Both reshape
atonement toward Participation and Christus Victor, with practical lives
reflecting union (EO) and triumph (DCW).

Let me know if you’d like more (e.g., modern EO theologians, further praxis) or
adjustments!

Continuing from the \~2,986-word comparison, I’ll explore how Eastern Orthodoxy
(EO) and the Divine Council Worldview (DCW) align in their disagreements with
Calvinism/Reformed theology—specifically TULIP (Total Depravity, Unconditional
Election, Limited Atonement, Irresistible Grace, Perseverance of the Saints)—and
Penal Substitutionary Atonement (PSA) in \~1,000 words. This will push the total
near my estimated output limit (\~4,096 tokens/\~3,000-3,500 words), so I’ll
stop and prompt you before hitting it. Using your cross-reference lists, I’ll
anchor the analysis in EO Fathers, DCW contributors, and atonement frameworks.

### EO and DCW Disagreements with Calvinism/TULIP and PSA (\~996 words)

#### Overview of Calvinism/TULIP and PSA

Calvinism, rooted in Reformed theology (e.g., John Calvin), articulates
salvation via TULIP:

-   **Total Depravity**: Sin renders humanity utterly incapable of good (Rom
    3:10-12).

-   **Unconditional Election**: God predestines the elect apart from merit (Eph
    1:4-5).

-   **Limited Atonement**: Christ’s death applies only to the elect (Jn 10:15).

-   **Irresistible Grace**: God’s grace ensures the elect’s salvation (Jn 6:37).

-   **Perseverance of the Saints**: The elect endure to the end (Phil 1:6).

PSA (Atonement Theories: PSA, Isa 53:5) posits Christ bears divine wrath as a
legal substitute for sinners’ guilt (Themes: Propitiation, Divine Justice as
wrath), central to Reformed soteriology (Rom 3:25).

#### EO Disagreements with TULIP and PSA

1.  **Total Depravity**:

    1.  **EO View**: Sin is ancestral corruption, not total loss of free will
        (Anthropology: Sin, Rom 5:12). Maximus the Confessor sees humanity
        wounded but capable of synergy with God (EO Authorities: cosmic
        Christology). Vladimir Lossky rejects depravity’s absoluteness,
        emphasizing *theosis* (EO Authorities: mystical theology).

    2.  **Contrast**: Calvinism’s inability (Themes: Sin as guilt) clashes with
        EO’s preserved freedom (Anthropology: Fall—wound vs. guilt), denying
        human cooperation in salvation.

    3.  **PSA Link**: EO’s corruption focus (Expiation, 1 Jn 2:2) rejects PSA’s
        guilt-driven wrath (Propitiation), per John of Damascus (EO Authorities:
        theology synthesis).

2.  **Unconditional Election**:

    1.  **EO View**: Gregory Palamas’ divine energies (EO Authorities:
        hesychasm) imply universal access to grace, not predestined election.
        Athanasius’ incarnation (EO Authorities: *theosis*) saves all
        potentially (2 Pet 1:4), conditioned on response (Themes: Human
        Destiny).

    2.  **Contrast**: EO’s synergy opposes Calvinism’s unconditional choice (Eph
        1:4), favoring free participation (Participation, Jn 17:21) over divine
        fiat.

    3.  **PSA Link**: EO’s universal scope (Reconciliation, 2 Cor 5:18-19)
        negates PSA’s limited wrath-bearing for the elect.

3.  **Limited Atonement**:

    1.  **EO View**: Basil of Caesarea sees Christ’s work sanctifying all
        creation (EO Authorities: creation, Rom 8:21). Georges Florovsky’s
        universal Church (EO Authorities: neo-patristic synthesis) rejects a
        restricted atonement (Themes: Cosmic Scope).

    2.  **Contrast**: Calvinism’s elect-only atonement (Jn 10:15) conflicts with
        EO’s cosmic renewal (Christus Victor, Col 2:15), where Christ dies for
        all (Ransom: Recapitulation).

    3.  **PSA Link**: PSA’s wrath for the elect (Isa 53:5) is alien to EO’s
        universal Restoration (Maximus).

4.  **Irresistible Grace**:

    1.  **EO View**: Symeon the New Theologian’s mystical union (EO Authorities)
        requires human assent (Anthropology: free will). Gregory of Nazianzus’
        redemption (EO Authorities) invites, not compels (Themes: Christ’s Role
        as mediator).

    2.  **Contrast**: Calvinism’s forced grace (Jn 6:37) contradicts EO’s
        cooperative *theosis* (Participation), per Stăniloaie (EO Authorities:
        personalist *theosis*).

    3.  **PSA Link**: EO’s grace as healing (Restoration) opposes PSA’s grace as
        wrath-satisfaction (Divine Justice).

5.  **Perseverance of the Saints**:

    1.  **EO View**: *Theosis* is dynamic, not guaranteed (Anthropology:
        Destiny). John Meyendorff notes potential to fall from grace (EO
        Authorities: Palamite theology), unlike Calvinism’s assured endurance
        (Phil 1:6).

    2.  **Contrast**: EO’s ongoing synergy (Themes: Human Destiny) rejects
        Calvinism’s fixed salvation, emphasizing process over predestination.

    3.  **PSA Link**: EO’s focus on union (Participation) over legal security
        (PSA) highlights the rift.

#### DCW Disagreements with TULIP and PSA

1.  **Total Depravity**:

    1.  **DCW View**: Sin is *elohim*-induced bondage (DCW Summary: Gen 3
        serpent), corrupting humanity’s image (Imes, Anthropology: Image).
        Heiser doesn’t frame it as utter inability but as cosmic disruption
        (Themes: Sin as bondage), with free will implicit in Bates’ allegiance
        (DCW Summary).

    2.  **Contrast**: Calvinism’s total depravity (Rom 3:10) exceeds DCW’s focus
        on external rebellion (Gen 6, 11), where humanity retains a role
        (Anthropology: Restoration).

    3.  **PSA Link**: DCW’s bondage (Redemption, Mk 10:45) leans to Christus
        Victor over PSA’s guilt/wrath (Propitiation, Isa 53:5).

2.  **Unconditional Election**:

    1.  **DCW View**: Staples’ covenant Israel (DCW Summary: Deut 32:9) suggests
        a chosen people, but Christ’s triumph (Col 2:15) universalizes
        redemption (Themes: Cosmic Scope). Heiser’s *elohim* narrative implies
        grace for all nations post-Babel (Gen 11).

    2.  **Contrast**: DCW’s universal reclamation opposes Calvinism’s elect-only
        predestination (Eph 1:4), favoring cooperative allegiance (Bates).

    3.  **PSA Link**: DCW’s broad scope (Christus Victor) rejects PSA’s limited
        wrath-bearing (Rom 3:25).

3.  **Limited Atonement**:

    1.  **DCW View**: Christ disarms *elohim* for all (Col 2:15, DCW Summary),
        restoring humanity universally as vice-regents (Imes, Themes: Cosmic
        Scope). Halsted’s apocalyptic lens (DCW Summary) sees cosmic victory,
        not selective salvation.

    2.  **Contrast**: Calvinism’s restricted atonement (Jn 10:15) clashes with
        DCW’s universal intent (Ransom: Recapitulation).

    3.  **PSA Link**: DCW’s liberation (Redemption) overrides PSA’s
        elect-focused wrath (Isa 53:5).

4.  **Irresistible Grace**:

    1.  **DCW View**: Bates’ allegiance (DCW Summary) requires human response to
        Christ’s victory (Col 2:15), not forced acceptance (Themes: Christ’s
        Role as victor). Heiser’s restoration assumes choice (Anthropology:
        Image).

    2.  **Contrast**: Calvinism’s irresistible pull (Jn 6:37) contradicts DCW’s
        voluntary loyalty (Participation).

    3.  **PSA Link**: DCW’s grace as triumph (Christus Victor) differs from
        PSA’s grace as legal necessity (Propitiation).

5.  **Perseverance of the Saints**:

    1.  **DCW View**: Imes’ restored image-bearers (DCW Summary) and Staples’
        covenant (Themes: Covenant) suggest an ongoing role, not assured
        permanence (Phil 1:6). Heiser’s focus on cosmic order allows for human
        agency (Themes: Human Destiny).

    2.  **Contrast**: DCW’s dynamic restoration opposes Calvinism’s fixed
        perseverance.

    3.  **PSA Link**: DCW’s Participation (*theosis*-like) contrasts PSA’s
        forensic security.

#### Shared EO-DCW Alignment Against Calvinism/PSA

-   **Sin**: Both see sin as corruption/bondage (EO: ancestral, DCW:
    *elohim*-driven), not total depravity (Anthropology: Fall), rejecting PSA’s
    guilt-wrath basis (Themes: Sin).

-   **Grace and Destiny**: EO’s synergy and DCW’s allegiance (Themes: Human
    Destiny) oppose TULIP’s predestination and irresistible grace, favoring
    Participation over PSA’s legalism (Restoration vs. Propitiation).

-   **Cosmic Scope**: EO’s universal renewal (Basil) and DCW’s *elohim* defeat
    (Heiser) reject Limited Atonement, aligning with Christus Victor and Ransom
    (Themes: Cosmic Scope).

-   **Divine Justice**: Both downplay wrath (EO: Lossky, DCW: Heiser’s focus on
    order), clashing with PSA (Themes: Divine Justice as love/order vs. wrath).

#### Conclusion

EO and DCW align in rejecting TULIP’s deterministic, wrath-centric soteriology
and PSA’s penal focus, favoring cosmic, participatory atonement (Christus
Victor, Participation, Ransom) grounded in Restoration and Redemption over
forensic pardon.

I’ve hit near the \~4,096-token limit. Proceed further (e.g., non-EO
comparisons) or adjust? Let me know!

Continuing from the \~3,982-word comparison, I’ll dig deeper into how Eastern
Orthodoxy (EO) and the Divine Council Worldview (DCW) disagree with
Calvinism/Reformed theology (TULIP) and Penal Substitutionary Atonement (PSA) in
\~1,000 words. Since we’re near my estimated output limit (\~4,096
tokens/\~3,000-3,500 words), this will push beyond it, so I’ll stop mid-analysis
and prompt you to proceed, ensuring no truncation mid-thought. Using your
cross-reference lists, I’ll explore theological nuances, scriptural tensions,
and practical divergences, leveraging EO Fathers and DCW contributors for depth.

### Deeper Disagreements: EO, DCW vs. Calvinism/TULIP and PSA (\~998 words)

#### Theological Nuances

1.  **Nature of Sin and Human Capacity**:

    1.  **EO**: Sin as ancestral corruption (Anthropology: Sin, Rom 5:12)
        preserves free will, per Maximus the Confessor (EO Authorities: cosmic
        Christology). Vladimir Lossky frames it as a relational rupture, not
        ontological destruction (EO Authorities: mystical theology), where
        humanity retains God’s image (Gen 1:26-27, Anthropology: Image—dynamic
        growth). This rejects Total Depravity’s claim of utter incapacity (Rom
        3:10-12), emphasizing synergy—human cooperation with grace (Themes:
        Human Destiny).

    2.  **DCW**: Sin stems from *elohim* rebellions (DCW Summary: Gen 3 serpent,
        Gen 6 Nephilim), corrupting humanity’s vice-regent role (Imes,
        Anthropology: Image). Heiser sees this as bondage (Themes: Sin), not
        total depravity—humans can respond via allegiance (Bates, DCW Summary).
        The Fall is cosmic interference, not complete moral collapse
        (Anthropology: Fall—wound vs. guilt).

    3.  **Vs. Calvinism/PSA**: TULIP’s Total Depravity posits no good remains
        (Calvin), necessitating PSA’s wrath-bearing substitute (Isa 53:5,
        Themes: Propitiation). EO’s *theosis* (Athanasius, 2 Pet 1:4) and DCW’s
        restoration (Imes) counter this with a wounded-but-viable humanity,
        favoring Participation (Jn 17:21) and Christus Victor (Col 2:15) over
        legal guilt (EO: Expiation, DCW: Redemption).

2.  **God’s Sovereignty and Human Freedom**:

    1.  **EO**: Gregory Palamas’ divine energies (EO Authorities: hesychasm)
        offer grace universally, requiring free assent (Anthropology: free
        will). John of Damascus rejects predestination’s determinism (EO
        Authorities: theology synthesis), seeing God’s will as inviting, not
        coercive (Themes: Christ’s Role—mediator). Unconditional Election and
        Irresistible Grace (Eph 1:4, Jn 6:37) are anathema—salvation is
        relational (Reconciliation, 2 Cor 5:18-19).

    2.  **DCW**: Heiser’s *elohim* narrative (DCW Summary: Ps 82) implies God
        delegates, not micromanages—humanity’s allegiance (Bates) post-rebellion
        (Gen 11) is voluntary (Themes: Human Destiny). Staples’ covenant Israel
        (DCW Summary: Deut 32:9) suggests election, but Christ’s triumph (Col
        2:15) universalizes it, opposing TULIP’s selective grace.

    3.  **Vs. Calvinism/PSA**: TULIP’s sovereignty (Unconditional Election,
        Irresistible Grace) eliminates freedom, tying PSA to a wrath-satisfied
        God (Rom 3:25, Themes: Divine Justice—wrath). EO and DCW align on
        synergy—EO mystically (Participation), DCW cosmically (Christus
        Victor)—rejecting PSA’s legal necessity.

3.  **Scope of Atonement**:

    1.  **EO**: Basil of Caesarea’s creation sanctification (EO Authorities:
        creation, Rom 8:21) and Georges Florovsky’s universal Church (EO
        Authorities: neo-patristic synthesis) see Christ’s work as cosmic
        (Themes: Cosmic Scope). Gregory of Nazianzus’ redemption (EO
        Authorities) is for all, not an elect (Ransom: Recapitulation, Rom
        5:19), opposing Limited Atonement (Jn 10:15).

    2.  **DCW**: Christ disarms *elohim* universally (Col 2:15, DCW Summary),
        restoring all nations (Deut 32:8-9, Themes: Cosmic Scope). Halsted’s
        apocalyptic victory (DCW Summary) and Imes’ image-bearers (Anthropology:
        Restoration) reject a restricted scope, aligning with Christus Victor.

    3.  **Vs. Calvinism/PSA**: Limited Atonement confines PSA’s wrath-bearing
        (Isa 53:5) to the elect, clashing with EO’s *theosis* for all (2 Pet
        1:4) and DCW’s reclamation of all (Redemption, Mk 10:45). EO and DCW
        share a universal intent, diverging from PSA’s exclusivity.

#### Scriptural Tensions

1.  **Romans 3:25 (Propitiation)**:

    1.  **EO**: NET v2 notes debate—“propitiation” (wrath) vs. “expiation”
        (cleansing). EO Fathers (e.g., John Meyendorff, EO Authorities: Palamite
        theology) favor expiation—Christ cleanses sin (1 Jn 2:2), not appeases
        wrath (Themes: Expiation). PSA’s legal lens is foreign.

    2.  **DCW**: Heiser allows PSA faintly (DCW Summary: sin’s rift, Rom 3:25),
        but prioritizes Christus Victor (Col 2:15)—*elohim* defeat over wrath
        (Themes: Redemption). Van Dorn’s soteriology (DCW Summary) might nod to
        PSA, but it’s secondary.

    3.  **Vs. Calvinism/PSA**: Calvinism reads Rom 3:25 as wrath satisfied
        (Propitiation), clashing with EO’s cleansing and DCW’s victory—both
        resist forensic wrath (EO: Restoration, DCW: Cosmic Scope).

2.  **Isaiah 53:5 (Punishment)**:

    1.  **EO**: Athanasius interprets Christ’s suffering as life-giving (EO
        Authorities: incarnation), not penal (Themes: Restoration). Dumitru
        Stăniloaie’s personalist *theosis* (EO Authorities) sees it as union,
        not substitution (Participation).

    2.  **DCW**: Imes’ representative restoration (DCW Summary: Heb 2:17) aligns
        with suffering for humanity, not wrath (Themes: Christ’s
        Role—representative). Heiser’s focus is *elohim* defeat (Col 2:15), not
        legal payment.

    3.  **Vs. Calvinism/PSA**: PSA’s “he was pierced for our transgressions”
        (Isa 53:5) demands wrath-bearing, rejected by EO’s healing and DCW’s
        cosmic triumph (Ransom: Vicarious Substitute).

3.  **Ephesians 1:4-5 (Predestination)**:

    1.  **EO**: Symeon the New Theologian (EO Authorities: mystical union) sees
        election as God’s desire for all, not a fixed decree (Themes: Human
        Destiny). EO rejects Calvinism’s predestination (Eph 1:4) for universal
        synergy.

    2.  **DCW**: Staples’ covenant (DCW Summary) is chosen, but Heiser’s
        universal victory (Col 2:15) implies open access (Themes: Cosmic Scope),
        not TULIP’s elect-only frame.

    3.  **Vs. Calvinism/PSA**: TULIP’s predestination underpins PSA’s limited
        scope—EO and DCW counter with universal intent (Reconciliation,
        Redemption).

#### Practical Divergences

1.  **Salvation Praxis**:

    1.  **EO**: Synergy drives asceticism and sacraments (Maximus, Anthropology:
        Restoration), opposing Irresistible Grace and Perseverance’s assurance
        (Themes: Human Destiny). Michael Pomazansky’s clarity (EO Authorities)
        rejects PSA’s legalism for *theosis* (Participation).

    2.  **DCW**: Allegiance (Bates) and image restoration (Imes) require active
        response (DCW Summary), not predestined security (Themes: Christ’s
        Role). Praxis resists *elohim* (Christus Victor), not pays wrath
        (Redemption).

    3.  **Vs. Calvinism/PSA**: TULIP’s passive reception and PSA’s forensic
        pardon contrast EO’s cooperative union and DCW’s cosmic loyalty.

2.  **Church and Mission**:

    1.  **EO**: Florovsky’s universal Church (EO Authorities) invites all
        (Themes: Cosmic Scope), rejecting Limited Atonement’s exclusivity. PSA’s
        wrath focus is absent—mission is *theosis* (Restoration).

    2.  **DCW**: Heiser’s nations reclaimed (Deut 32:9) and
        Wright/Stuckenbruck’s conflict (DCW Summary) drive a cosmic mission
        (Christus Victor), not elect salvation (Redemption).

    3.  **Vs. Calvinism/PSA**: TULIP’s elect-centered Church and PSA’s
        wrath-limited mission clash with EO and DCW’s universal outreach.

#### Alignment in Disagreement

EO and DCW unite against TULIP’s determinism (Total Depravity, Election, Grace)
and PSA’s wrath (Propitiation), favoring free will, universal scope, and cosmic
restoration (Participation, Christus Victor, Ransom). EO’s mystical rejection
(Lossky) and DCW’s *elohim* focus (Heiser) diverge in flavor but converge on
anti-legalism.
