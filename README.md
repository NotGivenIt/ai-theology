Using AI for Theological Q&amp;A and Papers

Basically, you paste in the template into a grok prompt  - https://grok.com . If you don't edit it, it will ask you your question. You can modify the yaml file to include your question from the start if you want.

After you do an ananlysis on a topic, I would then recommend asking:

> "Can you now re-evaluate my template file and offer suggestions to improve it based upon our discussion?"

This will allow you to then improve and customize the template file going forward for your own needs.# ai-theology
